# ILSVR classification and localization dataset

This repo contains a build script for the [Imagenet](http://www.image-net.org/) data set. 
After cloning the repository, in order to use the build script, you will first need to 
obtain an account with Imagenet and then download the following files.

1. `ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz`
2. `ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar`
3. `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar`
4. `ILSVRC2012_img_test_v10102019.tar`

File 1 containing the Imagenet development kit should be moved into the `./src` directory 
and then extracted.

```bash
$ tar -xzf ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz
```

Files 2-4 contain the raw image files and should be moved to the `./data` directory. **You do 
not need to extract files 2-4 the extraction process will be handled by the build script.** 

## Building the data set

### Creating and activating the Conda environment

The following commands can be used to create and activate the Conda environment containing the 
necessary Python packages to build the Imagenet data set.

```bash
$ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml
$ conda activate ./env
```
 
### Raw JPEG images

Running the following commands will extract and re-organize the raw *.JPEG images that comprise 
the Imagenet classification and localization data set. The resulting training, validation, and 
testing images can be found in `./data/jpeg/train`, `./data/jpeg/val`, and `./data/jpeg/test`, 
respectively.

```bash
$ cd ./src
$ python build-imagenet-datasets.py
```
